How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it helped me alot by finding the bugs faster than the traditional way and allow me to thinking about the part that changed rather than thinking about the entire file

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    by knowing the history of the file oi can roll back to the older version and allow me to compare between them and fix bugs easily  

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros : that u will control version manualy when a logical change is occured .
    cons : maybe u commite a very large change at once which make the commite hard to understand , 
            or u commite un logical related changes at once whic will make it hard to understand too ,
            or u will commite a very small change whic make a large history of commites to track ,
            so u only commite when the a related changes and not too large.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It depends on if the files are related so it make sense to commite it together so if i want to revert to the previus version it will revert all the related files to , 
    if the files no related it will be better if each one commited saperatly so if i want to revert changes happen to one it will not affect the other files    

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log:  will show me all the commits with some details like author and the date , 
    gitt diff: i compare between two commites shows which line added or deleted , 
    we can use git dif diffrent way if we set just one paramater not two it will show the number of line added and deleted from this commite only not compared with other commite.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    when making a change that cause break of something i can checkout to an older commite to see which commite cause this much easier .

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    working in my graduation project which is a large team so we had to create our repository and start work
