What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

a hidden folder (.git) is created which contain a meta data about the repository
, we need to do it to start the commite process

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area is contain the files that i will commite in the repository , if i want to commite multiple files i can put them in the staginga area then commite them at once .

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

by comparing the staging area with the working directory (git diff) , 
and comparing the staging area withe most recent commit (git difd --staged)
or after commite it u can simply compare the commites with (git diff commite1 commite2)
